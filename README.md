Welcome to Github for Journalists!

## What is Github? What is git?

Beyond the fact that `git` is a mysterious piece of software I can barely fathom, it is a piece of software used for version control. Whenever you make changes to a file that is tracked by `git`, both the old and new versions of that file are preserved in case you need to refer or revert to an earlier version. 

Github is a website built on top of `git` that allows for easier access and sharing of repositories for people on teams or to the wider public.

## Why should I use it?

Github allows you to track changes you make to your files, which can be useful when you are writing code, but also for many other applications. Github is particularly useful when you have more than one person working on the same project at once, and need to keep track of who is doing what work and where. 

Github also natively supports display for several types of files like Markdown, which this page is written in. It can also display Jupyter notebooks, CSV files, images TK in the browser, making it easy to share work. 

## The ways you can use Github

* The browser
* The desktop app
* The terminal

## Basic commands

* `git clone`
* `git status`

# Do not put passwords or other sensitive information in files you commit to Github!!! 

People will find them, and will make your life or your organization's existence miserable!

Remember too that Github preserves all versions of your code, so even past versions of your code can make you vulnerable.

Make sure to put any sensitive passwords or keys in a passwords file, and list it under gitignore so it won't be committed to your repository.
